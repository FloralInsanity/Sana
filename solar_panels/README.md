# Analysing Solar Panel Data

# Problem
* Energy prices are skyrocketing due to supply shortages.
* Therefore, we need to look at renewable sources to meet the demand.

# Question
* Are solar panels a worthwhile investment for UK citizens in the long-term?

# Motivations
* Solar energy is both renewable and clean.
* It will benefit the environment to use solar energy as opposed to sources like fossil fuels.

# Goals
* To gain insight into how much energy can be created by solar panels and the effect of typical UK weather (e.g. high rainfall) on that value.
* Make predictions about future energy yield.

# Nature of Data Collected
* Data format: Excel
* Data type: Structured
* Time frame: Over 480 days July 2013-November 2014
* Interval: Every 10 mins, every minute in the summer of 2014.
* Source: UK Power Networks

# Cleaning Dataset

* The original dataset had 38 columns and 70,000 rows

* Removed rows with missing values
* Removed columns unnecessary for analysis

# Conclusions
* Energy yield was between 65 and 155 watts per half hour. 130-310 watts/hour
* It beneficial to invest in solar panels regardless of location in UK
* There are other variables to consider like: type of solar panel, quality of equipment. 
* Between 250-300 watts per hour is average, consistent with the output of the YMCA solar panels
