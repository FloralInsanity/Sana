# [Project 1: Analysing Solar Panel Data](https://github.com/FloralInsanity/Sana_Portfolio/tree/main/solar_panels)
* Used the programming language R to analyse 70,000 rows of data provided by UK Power Networks.
* Determined energy yield per hour.
* Compared the yields of 5 locations based on the factors: temperature, humidity and rain.
* Formed conclusions about the data.
