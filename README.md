# [Project 1: Creating Dashboards to Display Solar Panel Data](https://github.com/FloralInsanity/Sana_Portfolio/tree/main/Solar_Panels)
* Used Python to create a dashboard using solar panel data provided by UK Power Networks.
* 5 dashboards, one for each location, with information about yield per half hour and weather in the past month.
* Created a table with mean yield of energy and weather conditions of each day and compared by % to average in the past month. 
* Hosted on Streamlit: https://floralinsanity-sana-solar-panelsdashboard-6bahju.streamlit.app/
